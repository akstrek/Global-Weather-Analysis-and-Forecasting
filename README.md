# Global Weather Analysis and Forecasting
In this project, I set out to explore global weather patterns and build a predictive model for forecasting future weather conditions. Leveraging the power of data science and time series analysis, the goal was to gain insights into how weather conditions change over time and across different geographical regions.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to weather data analysis, combining data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced time series forecasting techniques. By applying these methods to real-world weather data, the project aims to provide valuable insights that can be used for various applications, including climate research and disaster preparedness.
